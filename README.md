# RealEstate App ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the RealEstate app, a modern and intuitive application built with React Native and Expo. This project was created to help users search, rent, and purchase real estate properties with ease.

## Overview

The RealEstate app is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in finding and managing real estate properties. It features a user-friendly interface, dynamic elements, and a map to view nearby properties.

## Features

- **Property Listings**: Browse through a comprehensive list of properties with detailed information.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily search and filter properties based on various criteria.
- **Favorites**: Save your favorite properties for quick access.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both Android and iOS devices.
- **Map Integration**: View nearby properties on a map for better location context.

## Get Started

Follow these steps to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RealEstate.git
   cd RealEstate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Reset Project

When you're ready to start fresh, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
